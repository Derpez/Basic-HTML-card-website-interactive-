Its commented so you should be able to figure some stuff out atleast.

1.jpg is a placeholder card and you can put whatever on it, But please note that changing the size of the image could mess up the website and how things are loaded.

Adding more than 5 cards could lead to some issues with how cards are displayed (im still trying to figure out why and fix it).

html and css files are commented to put you in the right direction..
