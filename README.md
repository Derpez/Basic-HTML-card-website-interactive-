# Basic-HTML-card-website-interactive-
Its commented so you should be able to figure some stuff out atleast. [üëç]

1.jpg is a placeholder card and you can put whatever on it, But please note that changing the size of the image could mess up the website and how things are loaded.

Adding more than 5 cards could lead to some issues with how cards are displayed (im still trying to figure out why and fix it).

To open the website either drag the file in your browser or upload it on a web server..

html and css files are commented to put you in the right direction..

//* UPDATE *// 

I figured out a "working" solution for the cards getting messed up after 5 cards are added take the rest of your cards and put them in another html docutment and on the main document add a 5th button that will act as a next page button. Use the place holder image and make a image for the next page card and make it go the the 2nd index html document after the button is clicked. and you can do this more and more depending on how many cards you want to make...
